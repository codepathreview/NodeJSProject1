## Features

### Echo Server:

```bash
curl -v -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000 -d "hello self" -H "x-asdf: yodawg"
* Rebuilt URL to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
* Hostname was NOT found in DNS cache
*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 8000 (#0)
> POST / HTTP/1.1

*   Trying 127.0.0.1...
* Connected to 127.0.0.1 (127.0.0.1) port 8001 (#0)
> POST /asdf HTTP/1.1
> User-Agent: curl/7.37.1
> Host: 127.0.0.1:8001
> Accept: */*
> Content-Length: 11
